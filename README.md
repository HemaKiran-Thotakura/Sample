🧪 Sample

Welcome! This is a dedicated staging area and sandbox for my GitHub experiments.

I created this repository to serve as a "loading dock" while I figure out the best way to migrate and organize my drafted projects. It’s a space for testing workflows, refining README layouts, and getting comfortable with the GitHub ecosystem before the "real" code goes live.

🛠 What’s happening here?
Drafting: Testing how local drafts look once pushed to the cloud.

Learning: Exploring repository structures and documentation styles.

Sorting: Acting as a temporary home for ideas before they find their permanent repositories.

"Every great project starts with a 'sample' and a few lines of curiosity."
